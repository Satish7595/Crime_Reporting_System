# Crime_Reporting_System

Online Crime Reporting System:

With the rapid urbanization and development of big cities and towns, the graph of crimes is rising rapidly.
This phenomenal rise in offences and crime in cities is a matter of great concern. There are robberies, murders, smuggling, rapes and crimes which one can't think of.

Digitization of Records: 

Crime reporting solutions used today are trivial. Crime reports are still stored in paper records and evidences such as media files are stored in CD's or DVD's.
When the case progresses, the paper records and evidences tend to increase and makes it difficult to manage. Also, if a previous case is reopened after a long time, 
there is a hard time finding all the records regarding the case.
